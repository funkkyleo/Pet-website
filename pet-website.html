<h1>Meet Sukie - The Four Legged Ball of Energy</h1> 
<p>If joy had four paws, a wailng tail, and a never ending supply of playful mischief, it would be my dog, Sokie. She is a fluffy bundle of excitement who believes every day is a new adventure waiting to happen whether it is chasing butterflies, or turning my quiet mornings into comedy shows. Sukie does not just walk into a room; she bounces, prances, and somehow manages to bring sunshine with her.</p>
<h2>Sokie Favourite Foods</h2> 
<p>If you have ever met Sukie, you know two things instantly: she loves food almost as much as she loves fun. Her favourites foods are:
</p>
<li>Boiled fish head </li>
<li>Meat bone</li>
<li>Pap with milk</li>
